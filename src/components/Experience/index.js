        Hired to build a custom C parser, with main functionality of converting formatted recipe texts into ASTs for use
        in future programs or applications. Used Flex to generate a lexical analyzer, and Bison to generate a parser for
        tokenized input. Collected parsed input into an AST via C linked lists. Built a custom Python C extension module
        to convert C linked list into Python object.
        <ExperienceList>
          <li>Built a 1-off custom parser used to process recipes that follow the Cooklang language spec</li>
          <li>Programmed a test harness in Python to automatically test the parser on updates</li>
          <li>Programmed a script to convert general-category-specific Unicode code points from list and convert 
            to Flex compatible regular expressions</li>
